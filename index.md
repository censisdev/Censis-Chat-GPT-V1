What is Prompt Engineering?
Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining the initial text or input (the prompt) that is given to a language model like ChatGPT to generate a response. It involves designing prompts that guide the model to generate a specific tone, style, or type of content.

Prompt engineering is like giving a set of instructions to a robot, to make sure that the robot gives you the response you want.

Imagine you're playing a game with your friends where you ask the robot a question and the robot gives you an answer. If you give the robot a bad instruction, it will give you a bad answer. But if you give the robot a good instruction, it will give you a good answer.

That's how prompt engineering works with ChatGPT, it's about giving the model a good instruction so it can give you a good answer.
